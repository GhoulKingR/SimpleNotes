This is a simple note app. This is the first project I made outside the ones I made when following tutorials.

However, due to restrictions in distributing built applications, I won't be able to share a built version of this project. You may have to figure out how to install it on your system on your own. From the resources I saw while building the project, not every system may have the same defaults. I forgot what I did to get mine to work, but guides on the internet didn't work for me. But I can tell you that you need XCode to build it

## Requirements to install

Knowledge of how to install applications from repositories.

## Using the app

I made the user interface of this project as intuitively close as I could to the notes app that comes by default to macOS to make it easy to use.
